# Project Description
# A real estate management system that would allow a real estate company to store and query its listed properties, and the parties related to said listed properties. This database will allow employees of a real estate company to store and query all property listings, both past and present, that the company has been involved in. It will enable an agent to view information about a property, which agent listed said property, the contact information of the seller (or the seller’s lawyer), the building manager’s contact details (if the property is an apartment), and any disclosures that may have been made regarding the property (e.g., history or asbestos, nearby construction, etc.).
